# Color-Detection

Color detection is the technique of identifying any color's name. Isn't that easy? Well, this is a really simple assignment for people, but it is more complicated for computers. Light is converted into color by the eyes and brains of living things. Our eyes have light receptors that send the signal to the brain. The color is then recognized by our brain. We have associated specific lights with their color designations since we were little. To find color names, we'll employ an approach that is quite similar.
